We can combine these terms by adding their coefficients: 2x^2 - 8x^2 = -6x^2. Next, we will combine the terms with x. We have two terms with x, one with 2x and one with -2x. We can combine these terms by adding their coefficients: 2x - 2x = 0. Finally, we will combine the constant terms. We have two constant terms, one with 9 and one with -4.
